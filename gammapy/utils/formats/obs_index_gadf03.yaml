#YAML file containing the correspondance of the internal obs-index table in gammapy to the obs-index table format of GADF v.0.3.
#Concept:    For every name of the internal obs-index table, for either representation, "internal" or "disk", the corresponding unit, type and description are specified.
#Note:       This is a prototype containing only two names, "OBS_ID", "OBJECT".
